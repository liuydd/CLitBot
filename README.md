# CLitBot
This repo is a project for lecture _programming fundamentals_ of 2022fall.
You should use command lines to operate the robot to light up the lights in the game map.  
The whole process is a team work and I'm the leader.  
You can find the requirements in  .pdf _requirement_ and the information about the operation in .pdf _infodoc_.  
Please have fun in this not so delicate game.
